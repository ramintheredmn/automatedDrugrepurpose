automating the process of finding similar approved medicines to the cognate lignads of a desired target



You can either use Dockerfile (recommended way) or

create python env and install py dependencies ( in backend/req.txt )
  and node dependencies (npm install ) start node dev server (npm run dev) (frontend) and python flask server with python server proxy in config.next.js
  or just start the gunicorn server ( gunicorn apprun:app )

enjoy!
